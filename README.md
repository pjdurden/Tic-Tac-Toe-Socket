The AI Judge uses Alpha Beta pruning with minimax algorithm Alphaâ€“beta pruning is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that 
are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree. It is an adversarial search algorithm used commonly for machine playing of two-player games 
(Tic-tac-toe, Chess, Go, etc.). It stops evaluating a move when at least one possibility has been found that proves the move to be worse than a previously 
examined move. Such moves need not be evaluated further. When applied to a standard minimax tree
